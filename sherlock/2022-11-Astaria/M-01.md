# AuctionHouse firstBidTime is set to block.timestamp which breaks the calculation of the Auction's total duration
## Summary
AuctionHouse.sol firstBidTime is initialized to block.timestamp instead of 0, which makes the duration of the Auction incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail
```
newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
```
Since firstBidTime is set to block.timestamp and there is no bidder yet when the Auction starts, this if conditional will never run.
```
if (firstBidTime == 0) {
  auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
} else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
  uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
  _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
}
```
The firstBidTime thus acts as the start time of the Auction instead of the time of the first bid, which defies the protocol logic
```
// If this is the first valid bid, we should set the starting time now.  
```
## Impact
Auction timing might cause confusion for bidders.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change Line 80
```
newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
```
to
```
newAuction.firstBidTime = 0;
```
Also make sure that the code in endAuction() is changed because if firstBidTime is 0, the auction can end immediately after it starts.
```
require(
  ++ auctions[auctionId].firstBidTime !== 0 && 
  block.timestamp >= auctions[auctionId].firstBidTime + auctions[auctionId].duration,
  "Auction hasn't completed"
);
```
