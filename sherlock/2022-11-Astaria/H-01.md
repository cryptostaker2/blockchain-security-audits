# Bidder's payment is not refunded if Auction is cancelled prematurely via cancelAuction()
## Summary
If the auction creator decides to cancel the Auction when bidding is on going and bid is still less than reserve price, the last bidder who have already bid for a price will not get his money back.

## Vulnerability Detail
When bidders bid for a price in createBid(), their payment is handled through _handleOutGoingPayment and _handleIncomingPayment. The logic of both _handle functions is such that the current bidder is supposed to pay for the lastBidder's refund and the remaining amount is transferred to _handleIncomingPayment to pay off the lien debts (if any).

Eg Bid is currently at $500

- Alice decides to bid $650
- The bid is 5% above $500, so bid succeeds, and _handleOutGoingPayment is called
- _handleOutGoingPayment uses address(msg.sender) as a from and address to as a to, which means that Alice (the msg.sender) has to pay $500 to the previous bidder

```
  function _handleOutGoingPayment(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(weth, address(msg.sender), to, amount);
  }
```
- With the remaining $150, _handleIncomingPayment is called
- _handleIncomingPayment pays initiatorFee first before paying back the loan

```
        if (transferAmount >= lien.amount) {
          payment = lien.amount;
          transferAmount -= payment;
        } else {
          payment = transferAmount;
          transferAmount = 0;
        }


        if (payment > 0) {
          LIEN_TOKEN.makePayment(tokenId, payment, lien.position, payer);
        }
```

- If there is no loan, the $150 goes to the owner of the NFT

```
    } else {
      TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(
        weth,
        payer,
        COLLATERAL_TOKEN.ownerOf(tokenId),
        transferAmount
      );
    }
```
For Alice to get her money back, she has to either get outbid by another bidder (so _handleOutGoingPayment will pay her back), or she wins the auction and wins the NFT. However, the auction owner can cancel the auction by calling cancelAuction(). If that happens, Alice will not get her bid money back.

## Impact
A bidder will lose all his deposit if the Auction owner decides to cancel the Auction.
